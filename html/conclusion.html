		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p class="opening">
		The fingerprint scanner has been around for decades and is a great way to identify a user. There are many advantages to using a fingerprint, but there are also many disadvantages. The iris scanner eliminates most of these disadvantages and adds extra security and convenience. The technology is young, but this replacement is already happening in the Galaxy Note 7. Now that a commercial device using an iris scanner has been released, iris recognition will become more prevalent over the next few years and could possibly replace the fingerprint. There arises many ethical issues with the iris scanner. With some time, legal precedents should eliminate some of these ethical issues and quell the fears of those hesitant to use this new technology. Iris scanning technology may become the standard for identification and authentication in the coming years. According to initial research, the benefits greatly outweigh the disadvantages as compared to fingerprint scanning. Iris scanning could allow a more secure and convenient way for people to live their lives.
