		Bertolli discusses how iris biometrics work and the applications that currently use and will use iris biometrics in the future. Iris biometrics are used to identify someone by capturing a picture of their eye then comparing that picture to another in a database. The details of the picture are used to compare between both. The different patterns between the two are used to confirm or deny the comparison. Iris biometrics are already being used in the military and could be introduced in more places.

		The Galaxy Note 7 was released in the United States on August 19, 2016. It introduced the first iris scanner in a commercial cellphone device. The iris scanner is a separate camera on the front and is used to unlock the device. The Note 7 is currently available in the US, UK, and AU. This reference was used to determine the release date of the Note 7 in the United States.

		Geoghegan states that iris recognition is a more accurate alternative to fingerprint scanning. The use of iris scanners has been implemented by law enforcement agencies around the country. The company BI2 Technologies has already developed iris recognition technology and is offering it to corrections facilities around country. With this new technology comes new privacy issues. The use of iris recognition could very well violate citizens privacy and goes against their civil liberties.

		The National Science and Technology Council discusses iris recognition, the history behind it, how it works, and how it is used in society. Iris recognition was realized as a viable way to distinguish a person in 1936. This wasn’t expanded upon till 1987 when two ophthalmologists were awarded a patent for iris identification. The iris contains landmark features that are compared to a database. The use of a high quality camera is required in order to get an accurate render of the iris.

		Iris scanners are a biometric technology used to identify someone. The scanner mathematically compares one person’s eye to a database containing more information on the iris. The scanner can take multiple pictures in order to get a more accurate reading. The most popular utilization of the iris scanner will be in the commercial industry. Consumer electronics will hold a large share of iris scanners.

		Unlike fingerprints, the iris does not change over time. Each and every iris is unique to an individual and is protected by the eyelid and cornea. The iris contains certain characteristics that allow it to be identified and easily compared with the same iris. A mathematical formula is used to compare two irides. The sensor used to scan the iris must be specialized.

		Iris scans are already being implemented on a mass scale. There are airports and military installations that use iris scanning technology to determine if a hostile is present. The use of iris scanners eliminates the need for close encounters with a hostile. Iris scanning will become more prevalent in mobile devices. Using iris scanners increases the security of these devices.

		Iris recognition has many advantages and disadvantages. Iris recognition is quick and can be scaled to large numbers. The process of identifying someone with their iris is as follows: take picture of eye, focus on just the iris, determine the main features of the iris, match those features with a database, then get the results of the matches. John Daughman’s original algorithm is still used today in iris recognition. The Circular Hough Transform method is another way to utilize iris recognition.

		Biometrics are used to identify someone based on a unique set of physical attributes. Biometrics includes fingerprints, iris, facial, voice, and signature recognition. Iris scanning has a low fail rate and is fast. These biometrics are unique to an individual. Biometrics could be used for common use in the near future.
